ðŸ‘‹ I don't know why you're here, but hello!

-   my favorite so far this year was [day 5, binary boarding](./05-binary-boarding). so far it's the first one that made me test all the inner methods.

-   I did have a lot of fun w/ [day 3, toboggan trajectory](./03-toboggan-trajectory/03-1-lolz.js), as well.

-   my cleanest code so far this year is [day 2, password philosophy](./02-password-philosophy).
